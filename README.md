# Batman Movies

A demo of this project can be found at [Batman Movie Search Demo](https://youthful-heyrovsky-91dc02.netlify.com/)

## Roadmap

Enhancements I would like to make include:

* Add unit tests
* Add e2e tests
* Document components with Storybook
* Add search box to change search criteria
* Implement pagination to retrieve more than 10 results


## Information

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

## Development server

Run `npm run start:dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

A script that is already configured for creating a production build (including pulling in environment variables) can be run with `npm run build`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
